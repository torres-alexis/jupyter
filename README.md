This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks for the GL4U: RNAseq Bootcamp.

## Getting Started

You have two options to run these notebooks interactively:

1. **Gitpod**: Click on the "Open in Gitpod" button above. This will launch a Gitpod workspace with JupyterLab and all necessary dependencies installed.

2. **Binder**: Click on the "Launch Binder" button above. This will start a Binder environment with Jupyter Notebook and all required dependencies.
